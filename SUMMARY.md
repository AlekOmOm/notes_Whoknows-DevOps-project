## Created Topics

### Project Setup & Architecture
- Overview of project structure and architecture
- Detailed look at repository organization and layout

### Rust Backend Development
- Core concepts of Rust backend development
- Detailed exploration of ActixWeb framework implementation
- Covers handler patterns, middleware, and app structure

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- CI/CD pipeline structure and workflow
- Detailed analysis of the CD workflow design
- Explains job organization, artifact flow, and deployment processes

### Docker & Containerization
- Docker usage in Rust applications
- Multi-stage build patterns for efficient images
- Container orchestration with Docker Compose

### Environment Configuration Management
- Configuration strategies across environments
- Environment variables approach and patterns
- Secrets management and configuration flow

## Key Insights

1. **Layered Architecture**: The WhoKnows project uses a clean separation between API, domain logic, and infrastructure layers.

2. **DevOps Integration**: The Rust backend is designed with deployment in mind, using environment variables for configuration and proper error handling.

3. **CI/CD Workflow**: The project implements a robust CD pipeline that builds Docker images, publishes them to a registry, and deploys to development environments.

4. **Configuration Management**: A sophisticated approach to environment variables and secrets ensures security while maintaining flexibility.

5. **Docker Optimization**: Multi-stage builds create efficient, minimal images while maintaining good development experience.

6. **Security Focus**: Proper handling of authentication, secrets, and security concerns throughout the system.

## Future Additions

The repository could be enhanced with additional notes on:

1. **Database Integration**: Deeper exploration of SQLx usage and patterns
2. **API Design**: RESTful API design principles in Rust
3. **Testing Strategies**: Approaches to testing Rust web applications
4. **GitHub Actions Details**: More on workflow syntax and patterns
5. **Container Registry Management**: GHCR usage and best practices
6. **Deployment Strategies**: Server setup and deployment patterns
7. **Security Practices**: Detailed security considerations and implementations

## Development Principles

Throughout the notes, several core principles emerge:

1. **Type Safety**: Leveraging Rust's type system for correctness
2. **Environment Abstraction**: Clean separation of code and configuration
3. **Automation**: Consistent, reliable automation of build and deployment
4. **Immutable Artifacts**: Creating deterministic, traceable deployments
5. **Security By Design**: Security considerations at all levels
6. **Observability**: Proper logging and monitoring hooks
