## Key Insights

1. **Layered Architecture**: The WhoKnows project uses a clean separation between API, domain logic, and infrastructure layers.

2. **DevOps Integration**: The Rust backend is designed with deployment in mind, using environment variables for configuration and proper error handling.

3. **CI/CD Workflow**: The project implements a robust CD pipeline that builds Docker images, publishes them to a registry, and deploys to development environments.

4. **Configuration Management**: A sophisticated approach to environment variables and secrets ensures security while maintaining flexibility.

5. **Docker Optimization**: Multi-stage builds create efficient, minimal images while maintaining good development experience.

6. **Security Focus**: Proper handling of authentication, secrets, and security concerns throughout the system.

## Completed Additions

We've successfully added the previously identified "Future Additions":

1. **Database Integration**: Deep exploration of SQLx usage and patterns
2. **API Design**: RESTful API design principles in Rust
3. **Testing Strategies**: Approaches to testing Rust web applications

These topics now have dedicated notes that cover implementation patterns, challenges, and practical examples.

## Development Principles

Throughout the notes, several core principles emerge:

1. **Type Safety**: Leveraging Rust's type system for correctness
2. **Environment Abstraction**: Clean separation of code and configuration
3. **Automation**: Consistent, reliable automation of build and deployment
4. **Immutable Artifacts**: Creating deterministic, traceable deployments
5. **Security By Design**: Security considerations at all levels
6. **Observability**: Proper logging and monitoring hooks
7. **Simplicity**: Focusing on straightforward, maintainable patterns
